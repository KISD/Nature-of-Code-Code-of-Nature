Nature-of-Code-Code-of-Nature
=============================

Programming course, winter semester @ KISD; theory and experiments in a programming discourse

Ever since we have been trying to understand nature. Through observation, abstraction and formalization we are able to describe our environment. Thereby itâ€™s even possible to computate it. But is it that simple, as abstraction always means a reduction of the whole? Furthermore nature is also based on non-linear and dynamic processes which are hardly predictable by the use of conventional algorithms. Thereby alternative computational models are required.

We'll have a look on a mechanistic world view, the history of cybernetics and current research topics such as neural networks and genetic algorithms. Therefore we invite interestings guests, discuss texts and make small experiments.
