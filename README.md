Nature-of-Code-Code-of-Nature
=============================

Programming course, winter semester @ KISD; theory and experiments in a programming discourse

Ever since we have been trying to understand nature. Through observation, abstraction and formalization we are able to describe our environment. Thereby itâ€™s even possible to computate it. But is it that simple, as abstraction always means a reduction of the whole? Furthermore nature is also based on non-linear and dynamic processes which are hardly predictable by the use of conventional algorithms. Thereby alternative computational models are required.

We had a look on the mechanistic world view, the history of cybernetics and current research topics such as neural networks and genetic algorithms. Therefore we read and discussed contemporary theory and made small experiments which are shown on the [project page](http://kisd.github.io/Nature-of-Code-Code-of-Nature/).
